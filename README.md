# Koala Mercury Content Bundle

This Symfony 2 bundle combines the great efforts of the [Symfony CMF][1] team with the great HTML5 editor [Mercury][2].
The result is a very nice looking and simple CMS. All editing can be done inline.

This bundle is in development but should be usable.
The easiest way to get started is to use the [Symfony CMF sandbox][3]. More detailed instructions will follow.
